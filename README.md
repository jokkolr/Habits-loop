HabitLoop – Break Bad Habits

HabitLoop is a simple website that helps people work on breaking habits and addictions.
You can choose what you’re struggling with (like drugs, porn, smoking, gambling, alcohol, or risky behaviors) and get a step-by-step plan, a motivational quote, and a space to write your progress each day.

For risky sexual behavior, the site also includes warnings and a link to the Clarewell STI gallery so people can understand the risks before making decisions.
It’s lightweight, works on any phone or computer, and can be opened straight from your browser.
